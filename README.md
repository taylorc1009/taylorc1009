### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am currently a student at Edinburgh Napier University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Here, you will find: personal projects, university courseworks, and group projects I've contributed to during my time at university.

I like to write in:
* Low-level languages, such as C/C++.
* High-level languages - I currently have considerable experience in C# and Java, but I am currently looking learn more about Python and Kotlin/Dart.
* Web Frameworks - I'm beginning personal study of web apps. I have not produced any at a release level so far, but I am about to do so.
