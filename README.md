### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am currently a student at Edinburgh Napier University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Here, you will find: personal projects, university courseworks, and group projects I've contributed to during my time at university.

ðŸ˜„ I like to write in:
* Low-level languages, such as C/C++.
* High-level languages - I currently have considerable experience in:
	* C#
	* Java

ðŸ¤” I'm looking to learn/improve:
* Python - I did a small Python sentiment analysis as a university coursework, which kicked off my Python experience but I will expand it at some point.
* Dart (and Kotlin) - I have produced an Android app in Java, though I would like to write one in Kotlin at least.
* Web Frameworks - I'm beginning personal study of web apps. I have not produced any at a release level so far, but I am about to do so.
